# FriendBot
FriendBot is an AI-powered discord chatbot who is able to talk with discord users through messages and voice channels using a voice synthesizer. This project is for RCOS and will primarily serve as an entry level project for learning about AI development. The idea for this project is heavily inspired by vedal987.
